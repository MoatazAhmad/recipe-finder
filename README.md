# purpose of it
the purpose of this project is to practice react , it is simple and this is what is required to be simple but still make me practice my react skills 

## Challenges

One of the main challenges I faced during this project was **passing data between components**. Having previously worked with Vue, I was accustomed to its reactive data flow and simpler ways of managing component communication. React's approach, with its `useState`, `props`, and state lifting, initially felt a bit more complex and unfamiliar.

It was definitely an adjustment! ðŸ˜… However, this challenge helped me gain a deeper understanding of Reactâ€™s component-based structure and state management, which ultimately improved my React skills.
